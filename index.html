               Of what I can already do. Of what I cannot do and am willing to learn.</p>
            <p class="experience__desc grey">All the pictures below have been chosen for their aesthetic. I did not use screenshots or logos from the actual companies because it would have been, well, uglier… and I am not sure I have the right to, anyway. Thanks Pexels for always being there. *un coeur qui bat*</p>

               I am just your run-of-the-mill front-end developer. I wanted to be an artist. I like creativity and unleashing my imagination. I did not go that way because I also like money. The government seems pretty happy about my choice to pay more taxes.</p>
            <p class="experience__desc grey">Usually a well hidden secret, I feel that I should tell you before you read any further : I love working in music. Do not worry, I wear headphones. But I sing. And it’s terrible.</p>

               They sell cars. New ones. Used ones. The website was kind of old and not so pretty. I was brought into the team to help change that. I think we did okay.</p>

               Slidor.</h2>
            <p class="experience__desc">
               Those of us who are not hippies need money to live. And what better way to obtain it than to get people to give it to you ? This is what Slidor is (mainly) about: creating breathtaking presentations in Microsoft Powerpoint to impress investors.</p>
            <p class="experience__desc grey">This website was coded only by yours truly (at the time) but each page describing a production was done by a different designer. It involved ~brainstorming~ fighting a lot over what was possible and what was a good, possible idea with 7 people in a row... Print designers are great and make amazing assets but they are NOT easy on the developers for the web.<br>But we almost won an Awwward for it. https://www.awwwards.com/sites/slidor-1</p>

            <p class="experience__desc">
               Speaking of investors, Kerala Ventures throw small french companies into the deep end of the pool to better launch them into space.</p>

               A little bit<br>of everything.</h2>
            <p class="experience__desc">
               While working at Slidor, I not only coded their website, I also worked for a few of their clients who wished to offer to their own visitors a website that looked just like the presentation that was made for them: full of personality and pixel-perfectly pretty.</p>
            <p class="experience__desc grey">Ensue many hours of slightly moving this image. Slightly changing the timing of this animation. Slightly darkening the font color. Slightly killing myself every morning opening my messaging app. It was truly a great experience. I learned that sleep is just a concept.</p>

               Sometimes<br>I get bored.</h2>
            <p class="experience__desc">
               And I make stuff. Or rather, I try to, abandon it halfway through and never finish it. And when I have enough of painting pixels, I switch to real-life painting.</p>
            <p class="experience__desc grey">I like Codepen because it is full of great ideas to steal for later… way later.</p>
